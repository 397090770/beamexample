# Apache Beam Example

An example Apache Beam project.

This example can be used with conference talks and self-study. The base of the examples are taken from Beam's `example` directory. They are modified to use Beam as a dependency in the `pom.xml` instead of being compiled together. The example code is changed to output to local directories.
